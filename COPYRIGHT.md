## The short version

**You may:** use it, run it, self-host it, fork it, modify it, use it commercially,
build a business on it, and re-skin it entirely as your own brand.

**You must:** keep the copyright notice, and keep the author credit visible.

**You may not:** claim you wrote it, or strip the attribution and pass it off as
original work.

That's the whole deal.

## ✅ What you are free to do

| | |
|---|---|
| 🏢 **Use it commercially** | Run client channels with it, charge for the service, keep the money. No revenue share, no licence fee, no permission needed. |
| 🎨 **Re-brand it completely** | Change the app name, colours, persona, niche, logo and copy. The product can look entirely like yours — that is what the white-label system is for. |
| 🔧 **Modify anything** | Fork it, rip parts out, bolt parts on. No obligation to contribute changes back (though pull requests are welcome). |
| 📦 **Redistribute it** | Ship it to clients, bundle it, host it for others. |
| 🔒 **Keep your changes private** | This is MIT, not GPL. Your fork does not have to be open source. |

## ⭐ What is required in return

### 1. Keep the copyright notice

The MIT licence requires the notice in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) to travel with the software.
Keep that file in any copy or substantial portion you distribute. This is the legally
binding part.

### 2. Keep the author credit visible

The dashboard footer links to [github.com/ys941](https://github.com/ys941). Everything
*around* that credit is yours to change — the app name above it follows your Brand
settings — but the credit itself should stay.

The server also declines to start until you acknowledge this, by setting:

```bash
ATTRIBUTION_ACK="https://github.com/ys941"
```

Nothing is transmitted anywhere. No network call is made, no telemetry is collected,
no licence server is contacted. The value is compared to a string in
[`lib/attribution.ts`](lib/attribution.ts) and that is all.

> **On honesty:** that check is trivial to delete, and this is an MIT-licensed
> repository, so you would be within your rights to do so. It is a request and a
> speed bump, not enforcement. It costs you a single line in a footer, and it is the
> only thing asked in exchange for several months of work given away for free.
> Please leave it in.

## ❌ What is not okay

- **Claiming authorship.** Don't present this as software you wrote.
- **Removing the copyright notice** from copies you distribute — that one is an actual
  licence violation, not just bad manners.
- **Re-uploading it as your own project** with the attribution stripped.
- **Implying endorsement.** Building on this doesn't mean the author endorses, supports
  or is responsible for what you build.

## 🌐 What this copyright does *not* cover

This notice and the MIT licence cover **the source code in this repository only**.

They grant no rights to, and carry no warranty regarding:

- **Third-party APIs** the software talks to — Google (YouTube, Gemini),
  Groq, Cerebras, Cloudinary, Jamendo, Resend and any other provider
  you configure. Each remains subject to that provider's own terms, and you supply your
  own credentials.
- **Assets fetched at runtime** — music, images and models carry their own licences.
  Jamendo tracks, for example, are Creative Commons and must be credited, as the
  software does by default.
- **Content the software generates and publishes on your behalf.** You are the operator
  of your accounts. You remain responsible for what is posted, for each platform's
  policies, and for any applicable rules on automated posting, advertising and
  disclosure.

See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for the full detail.

## 🩺 Not a medical device

This software performs no medical function and gives no medical advice. Nothing it
produces is a diagnosis, a clinical recommendation, or a substitute for a qualified
clinician.

## 📬 Questions

Unsure whether your use is okay? Just ask — the answer is almost always yes.
