/**
 * lib/richCaption.ts
 *
 * Builds ONE unified, beautiful, detailed caption used for every YouTube Short.
 *
 * The caption is a Grok-elaborated, emoji-structured prose caption:
 *   hook line → intro → 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ expanded key points → "💡 Why it matters" → CTA.
 * It contains NO hashtags — callers append the post's hashtags themselves.
 *
 * Caching (guarantees identical text + avoids duplicate Grok calls):
 *   The prose caption is stored on the post's `reelScript` field. Once a rich
 *   caption is generated it is persisted back as `reelScript = "RICHCAP:" + text`.
 *   On any later read we return that stored text verbatim, so Grok runs only once.
 *   The legacy `"CAPTION:"` prefix is still accepted as a fallback source.

CRITICAL FIDELITY RULES:
- Cover EVERY key point above — one caption line per card point, in the same order.
- Use the EXACT statistic/number from each point. NEVER invent, change, round, or substitute a different figure. If a point says "43%", the caption says "43%".
- Do not skip a number in the sequence (no jumping ①②③⑤). Do not add points that aren't in the content.
- Then ADD depth to each: the mechanism (why/how it happens) and why it matters for the viewer — but keep the card's own fact intact.
${quiz ? "\nIMPORTANT: This is a QUIZ post. NEVER state, reveal, or hint at the correct answer anywhere in the caption — the answer is only revealed later in the comments.\n" : ""}
Structure it EXACTLY like this, with real line breaks between sections and tasteful emojis:
1. An opening HOOK line with a relevant emoji — 1 punchy sentence that stops the scroll.
2. A 2-3 sentence intro paragraph that frames why this matters and what the viewer will learn.
${learnSection}
4. "💡 Why it matters:" 1-2 sentences of real-world relevance.
${ctaSection}

Tone: authoritative but warm and accessible — like a brilliant expert who's a great teacher. Use tasteful emojis as section markers and bullet leads. NO markdown symbols (* # _), NO hashtags (added separately). Make it FULL, rich and genuinely DETAILED — aim for about 380-480 words. Expand EVERY key point thoroughly with the specific stat/number, the mechanism, and why it matters for the viewer. This is the complete YouTube description (it runs in full on the Short). Do NOT pad with filler — every line must be substantive and informative.`;
