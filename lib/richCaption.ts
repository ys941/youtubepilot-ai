/**
 * lib/richCaption.ts
 *
 * Builds ONE unified, beautiful, detailed caption that is used IDENTICALLY on
 * both Instagram and YouTube for every post — whether the post originates on IG,
 * YouTube, or both.
 *
 * The caption is a Grok-elaborated, emoji-structured prose caption:
 *   hook line → intro → 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ expanded key points → "💡 Why it matters" → CTA.
 * It contains NO hashtags — callers append the post's hashtags themselves.
 *
 * Caching (guarantees identical text + avoids duplicate Grok calls):
 *   The prose caption is stored on the post's `reelScript` field. Once a rich
 *   caption is generated it is persisted back as `reelScript = "RICHCAP:" + text`.
 *   On any later read (the other platform's publisher) we return that stored text
 *   verbatim, so IG and YT always carry the same caption and Grok runs only once.
 *   The legacy `"CAPTION:"` prefix is still accepted as a fallback source.
